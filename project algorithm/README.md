# Abstract
In the first topic of the seminar was the exploration of the concept of algorithms. We build a list of instructions for People to execute with pen and paper with the intention to transform these results into a digital form. 

The core of the analog version of the algorithm is the generation of random wax drops on a paper based on the age of the executing person. The contours around these drops shall end up in a organic overlaying grid which mesmerizes the viewer.
